        <ul>
             <li>2 pounds veal shanks, cut into short lengths</li>
             <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
             <li>¼ cup Butter</li>
             <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
             <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
             <li>1 large carrot, chopped</li>
             <li>⅔ cup dry white wine </li>
             <li>⅔ cup beef stock </li>
             <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
             <li> salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Gremolata:</h3>

        <ul>
             <li>½ cup chopped fresh flat leaf parsley</li>
             <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
             <li>2 teaspoons grated lemon zest</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        
         <ol>
                <li> Dust the veal shanks lightly with flour. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Add the veal, and cook until browned on the outside. Remove to a bowl, and keep warm. Add two cloves of crushed garlic and onion to the skillet; cook and stir until onion is tender. Return the veal to the pan and mix in the carrot and wine. Simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li> Pour in the tomatoes and beef stock, and season with salt and pepper. Cover, and simmer over low heat for 1 1/2 hours, basting the veal every 15 minutes or so. The meat should be tender, but not falling off the bone. </li>
                <li> In a small bowl, mix together the parsley, 1 clove of garlic and lemon zest. Sprinkle the gremolata over the veal just before serving. </li>
         </ol>
