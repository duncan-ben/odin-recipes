    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>

             <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
             <li>¼ cup water</li>
             <li>1 ½ cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
             <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt </li>
             <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</li>
             <li>⅓ cup cornstarch</li>
             <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
             <li>1 (16 ounce) package mozzarella cheese sticks</li>

        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        
         <ol>
                <li> Whisk water and eggs together in a small bowl. Mix bread crumbs and garlic salt together in a medium bowl. Blend flour and cornstarch together in a third bowl. </li>
                <li> Heat oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C) in a large, heavy saucepan. </li>
                <li> Dredge a mozzarella stick in flour; shake off excess. Dip into egg mixture. Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat. Place breaded mozzarella stick on a plate or wire rack. Repeat with remaining mozzarella sticks. </li>
                <li> Use a spider spoon or a pair of tongs to lower 3 to 4 mozzarella sticks into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels. Repeat to fry remaining mozzarella sticks. </li>
         </ol>
